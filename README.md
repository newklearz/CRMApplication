# CRMApplication
This is a basic CRM web application made with Spring MVC, Hibernate, Java and MySQL, using an Apache Tomcat server.


I made this application using DAO design pattern with Service facade that's able to connect to a db and perform CRUD operations like adding a new customer, getting all the customers registered in db
on the home page, update an existing customer by redirecting the client in a prepopulated fields that he can edit and save and delete any customer from the db using the delete button.
